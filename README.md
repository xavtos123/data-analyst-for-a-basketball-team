# data-analyst-for-a-basketball-team
You are a data analyst for a basketball team. You have found a large set of historical data, and are working to analyze and find patterns in the data set. The coach of the team and your management have requested that you use descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques to study distributions of key variables associated with the performance of different teams. Data-driven analytics will help the management make decisions to further improve your team’s performance. You will use the Python programming language to perform your statistical analysis. You will also need to present a report of your findings to the team’s management. Since the managers are not data analysts, you will need to interpret your findings and describe their practical implications. The managers will use your report to find areas where the team can improve its performance.
